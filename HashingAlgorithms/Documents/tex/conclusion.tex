Our research presents the evolution of hash functions. Due to great advances in their cryptanalysis over the past decade, the necessity to move away from the underlying constructions most  hashing algorithms relied on up until recently: the Merkle Damg\r{a}rd construction.
In recent years, significant advances in the  eld of hash function research have led to birth of a whole new class of hash functions, based on the sponge construction
With the advance of differencial cryptanalysis,  hashing algorithms such as SHA1 and MD5 are no longer deemed cryptographically secure.
And despite the fact the SHA-2 family of functions is still deemed secure, inherent weaknesses in the Merkle Damgard underlying constructruction led to birth of a whole new class of hash functions, based on the sponge construction.
