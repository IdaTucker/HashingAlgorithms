  With the increasing amount of sensitive data that is relayed on the internet, the requirement for secure hashing algorithms has surged.
  Hashing functions are used for many cryptographic purposes, namely authenticity and integrity of a given message with digital signatures, key derivation, and pseudorandom bit generation.
  
  In this report we first present the  Merkle-Damg\r{a}rd construction, a legacy pattern used to develop hashing algorithms, such as MD5, SHA1, and many others.
  %After which we will study the weaknesses of these functions, namely their frailty against differencial crytptanalisis %
  
  Finaly we will discuss the need for a new family of hashing algorithms, based on a different model: the sponge construction. And we will define the SHA-3 family of hashing algorithms, based on this construction and an underlying permutation \textsc{Keccak}, that have been approved by the NIST\footnote{National Institute of Standards and Technology}.
